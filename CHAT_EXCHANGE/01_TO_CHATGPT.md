PLANNING PHASE OUTPUT FROM CLAUDE

Claude has created the attached plan for the Opportunity Evaluator project.
Please review and provide:

1. Any missing components or considerations
2. Suggested changes to metrics/formulas
3. Concerns about tech stack choices
4. Approval to proceed with implementation OR requested revisions

User note: "From this point on I want to just copy and paste back and forth.
Don't ask me implementation details - you and Claude figure it out. I know
the end product I want but the function is up to you both."

When approved, I'll paste your go-ahead back to Claude to begin implementation.
